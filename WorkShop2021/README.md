# Smart Home
> “When you bring your home and technology together, it can be referred to as “Smart Home.” For instance, lights, switches, audio speakers, thermostats, security cameras are connected to a common system and can control the entire home by itself.
> With a smart home, you can explore the world of high-tech functionality and luxury that was not necessarily possible in the past.”
 
**Project Scenario:**
  * The home contains a LCD to display the home’s temperature.
  * The fan (DC motor) will continuously work according to the home’s temperature (if it too high).
  * To save energy, the lights (at least one LED) in the house gradually turn on according to the intensity of the lighting inside the home.
  * For home security, there will be three buttons, when pressed in a certain pattern, the home’s door (servo motor) will open. and show if the pattern correct or not on the second row on LCD.
  * When your car arrives in front of the home's garage, the garage will detect the distance to the car and when you be near the door (servo motor) will open.
