# Session 1
## [Task 1](https://github.com/omarhesham2/Robotech/blob/main/Basic_Arduino/Session1/T1Code.ino)

**We have 2 cases :**
  * **Case 1 :** If you press the button the LEDs light at MAX volt. 
  * **Case 2 :** if you press the button Twice , control the 2 LEDs (analog) using 	potentiometer, 
  but LED 1 lights as inverse of LED 2 \
  (if led 1 is at its maximum light value then LED 2 is off) & (there is a value 127 that the 2 LEDs light the same).
